Scripts adapted from bp-combustion-project-p2at2/MPEA_paper/workflow/

Note: a few CISD RDMs are missing, the list is in the gather.out file
For some of them, they were just computed in a different workflow (case of the 
Hamiltonians read from generalized orbital frames workflows)
For most CISD RDMs for Natural Orbitals though, they are missing because
they had to be computed in a different step.

I will attempt to find those at a later time...

All files are stored on AWS S3 in the following bucket:
s3://zapata-zmachine/projects/bp-combustion-project/phase-2/mpea-runtime/data/publication-data/

Files are named with <molecule name>-<number of active spatial orbitals>-<orbital type>.tgz
in the top directory. The number of qubits is twice the number of active spatial orbitals. 
Orbital type can be either canonical (obtained from HF calculation) or NOs (obtained from MP2
amplitudes, diagonalizing the MP2 density matrix). 

Canonical orbitals are truncated by energy and NOs by occupation numbers. The top level directory 
contains interaction operators computed from Psi4.

The qubitops subdirectory contains the same operators transformed in the qubit basis by a 
Jordan-Wigner transformation.

The cisd-rdms subdirectory contains the CISD 1-RDM and 2-RDM for each molecule, active space and 
orbital type (except for the missing ones).


#### AWS login ####
To login to AWS, download and install the AWS command line tool.
Then do 
aws sso login --profile zapata-zmachine

After that you cna use aws commands to download or upload files to S3:
aws s3 cp s3://zapata-zmachine/key/to/file .
would copy "file" locally for example.
